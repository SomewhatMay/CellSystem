Each generation should have a random number of cells. The rules that determine cell reproduction:

We use a method to determine the percentage using this method:
1 / (3.1 * n) => percentage of cells that should be of specific ancestry
n represents the place in the leaderboard. For example, the first cell in the leaderboard will have ~30% of the future cell's reproduction and the second will have ~15%. Only cells placed 1 through 10 on the leaderboard get reproduced (~90%). The remaining cells are destroyed (10%) and are replaced by new, random-schedule generated cells. This is to ensure that cells that are useless do not get reproduced, and are replaced by chances of new cells that may have better characteristics.

Each reproduced cell (excluding the 10% newly-generated cells) are to have a 1/10 chance of having a mutalation in each of its dna digits.
